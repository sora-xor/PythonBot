# PythonBot

PythonBot is a simple bot that can execute swaps on Polkaswap!

Just `pip install substrate-interface` and `pip install scalecodec` and you should be good to go.

# Troubleshooting
Use `update_custom_types.py` to update `custom_types.json` if there are type errors.

# LICENSE

Apache 2, so feel free to have fun :)
